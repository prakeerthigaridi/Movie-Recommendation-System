It has been evidenced by the extremely busy world today, the 
recommendation systems have drawn huge attention. People always 
seem to fall behind time to do the various tasks to be completed within 
the 24 hours they are, by and large, bound limitedly by. The whole 
concept of the recommendation system finds out the content that 
would, in the final analysis, be deemed interesting to an individual. 
Thus, this movie recommendation system would actually recommend 
numerous movies to users based on what a user would be interested in 
or the popularities of the movies. In fact, this system processes several 
sets of data retrieved from a user's input and further recommends 
similar kinds of movies to the user. This actually brings out relevance 
in context along with some insights, which in turn enhances user 
experience. Broadly speaking, movie recommendation systems prove 
to be a nice way of allowing users to find exciting contents from the 
myriad of resources that the world of cinema has in store for them.
